# About

This is a bash script containing the install instructions from the [AtoM install page for linux](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/2.4/admin-manual/installation/linux/ubuntu-xenial/).

You can try it be installing a fresh Ubuntu Xenial VM with Google or AWS, then just:

- wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardlehane/install-atom/master/install.sh
- chmod +x install.sh
- sudo ./install.sh

If all goes as planned, you should have a fresh AtoM instance available for configuration at http://localhost.
